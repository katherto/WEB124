                <h2>Essential JavaScript best practices: Explain the pros and cons of...</h2>
                <p>1. inline vs. embedded vs. external JavaScript using examples.</p>
                <p>Pro: Inline or Embedded JavaScript can provide for a way to easily test some idea without need of creating a new file and properly linking it within the HTML code.  External JavaScript is favored as it keeps the behavioral aspects of a webpage separate from the content and structure.</p>
                <p>Con: Using inline or embedded JavaScript can make it harder to update specific parts of a webpage and can make it harder to read</p>
                <p>Code Example:<br>
                    <code>
                        let today = new Date();<br>
                        let hourNow = today.getHours();<br>
                        let greeting;<br><br>
                        
                        if (hourNow > 18) {<br>
                            greeting = 'Good evening!';<br>
                        } else if (hourNow > 12) {<br>
                            greeting = 'Good afternoon!';<br>
                        } else if (hourNow > 0) {<br>
                            greeting = 'Good morning!';<br>
                        } else {<br>
                            greeting = 'Welcome!';<br>
                        }<br><br>

                        By including all this code within a script tag in the middle of HTML code, if for some reason the JavaScript for the page breaks due to an update someone might not think to browse the HTML document itself and find these specific lines to correct.
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>2. indenting your code.</p>
                <p>Pro: Makes the resulting page of code more readable for others to follow along and update as necessary</p>
                <p>Con: It may take more time and if indenting is inconsistent will result in code that's harder to read</p>
                <p>Code Example:<br>
                    <code>
                        if (x > 1) {<br>
                            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return false;<br>
                        }<br><br>
                        vs.<br><br>
                        if (x > 1) { return false}
                    </code>
                </p>
                <p>3. inserting code comments</p>
                <p>Pro: Code comments are essential for documenting the work you're doing while programming.  It'll help others who update the code with important information that help explains logic or what the code is programmed to do.</p>
                <p>Con: Code comments also take more time than straight programming without them.  If comments are too general or vague there is risk of having poorly documented code that doesn't explain itself well.</p>
                <p>Code Example:<br>
                    <code>
                            // each time an h2 element is clicked random hex values are chosen and set as a gradient for the background<br>
                            document.body.style.backgroundImage = "linear-gradient(to bottom, #" + Math.floor(Math.random()*16777215).toString(16) + ", #" + Math.floor(Math.random()*16777215).toString(16);<br><br>
                            Without the comment someone following up on this project may wonder why random numbers are being generated and what it has to do with styling with JavaScript
                    </code>

                <h2>Java vs. JavaScript</h2>
            </section>
            <ul>
                <li>What is the general purpose for each language?<br>
                Java is generally used to create mobile and desktop apps, web apps, games, etc.  JavaScript is used to control the behavior of a webpage and certain frameworks of JavaScript can be used to create more specific things like mobile apps.</li>
                <li>Strict vs. loose variable typing - what does this mean as it relates to Java and JavaScript?<br>
                Loose variable typing allows you to assign a name/value pair without first declaring the variable itself, whereas strict explicity expects a variable definition before assigning it a value.  In JavaScript, to use strict typing an instruction "use_strict"; is set at the beginning of the JavaScript document.</li>
                <li>Where is the source code for each language compiled or interpreted?<br>
                For Java, a Java compiler reduces source code to bytecode, then is run on a Java Virtual Machine.  In contrast, the major browsers running JavaScript have an interpreter to translate the code into something the computer can follow.</li>
