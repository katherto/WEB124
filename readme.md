# WEB 124 JavaScript II

These are the course projects for JavaScript when I took the course at JCCC during the fall 2019 semester.  Not a lot of new concepts or syntax was defined for JavaScript but continued to reinforce what we already learned while pushing further.  The JS30 projects are of particular note as it gave me an opportunity to explore projects by Wes Bos at [JavaScript 30](https://javascript30.com/).  These allowed me to better understand the control JavaScript can have over the DOM and new ways to manipulate it.
